      "Join Becodemy! Becodemy focuses on practical applications rather than just teaching the theory behind programming languages or frameworks. I took a lesson on creating a web marketplace using React JS, and it was very helpful in teaching me the different stages involved in creating a project from start to finish. Overall, I highly recommend Becodemy to anyone looking to improve their programming skills and build practical projects. Becodemy is a great resource that will help you take your skills to the next level.",
